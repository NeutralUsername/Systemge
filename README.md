Library for building message based distributed systems through async and sync TCP/TLS communication as well as featuring custom http-server and websocket-server implementations for serving frontends, websocket endpoints or creating a rest-api.  
  
Clients can subscribe to message topics to receive a copy for each published message of this topic.  
The Topic Resolver resolves the address and tls-cert of a broker corresponding to the given topic. This happens after initializing the resolver automatically in the background.
